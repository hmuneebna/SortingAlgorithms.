Task #1:


	In the QuickSort program, and in the MergeSort program, the user will be asked to input the size of integers. Once the user inputs the size of integers, the program will then sort the 'n' amount of randomized integers that the user inputted. For an example, if the user inputs 10, the program will sort through 10 randomized positive integers.  The user must only input a positive integer for the size of 'n'.
